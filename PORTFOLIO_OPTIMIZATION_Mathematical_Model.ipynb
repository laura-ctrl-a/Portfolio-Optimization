        "This report aims to optimize a financial portfolio throught the best allocation of the asset that the market offers that gives the best trade off between risk and return given the user's risk tolerance.  The goal is to set the best allocation investments across various assets in a way that maximizes the difference between the portfolio's expected return and the portfolio risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "The model utilizes metrics like the mean daily return, based on an temporal horizont of 5 years (2020-2025) , risk-volatility (variance and covariance), and the daily cost of the day the investor decides to buy the assets.\n",
        "Other constant parameters are given by the user 's preferencies and financial goals like the risk tolerance, the maximum risk tolerance, the minimum number of asset to allocate , and the limits of fractional investment.\n",
        "\n",
        "The maximization problem is subjected by optimization constraints that may include minimum and maximum allocations for each asset, as well as limitations on total risk.\n",
        "\n",
        "The problem is typically approached using mathematical modeling techniques ,\n",
        "in the field of the mathematical mixed integerlinear programming problem, that is solved using the so called simplex algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "The conclusion is to see how the asset allocation varies given different values of risk tolerance and to customize the portfolio to reflect individual preferences for both returns and risk exposure, providing a practical tool for investment decisions."
